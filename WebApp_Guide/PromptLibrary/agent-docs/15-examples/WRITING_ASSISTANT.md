# 📄 Writing Assistant

> **Overview**: Comprehensive guide and reference for **writing_assistant**.

## 🔍 Conceptual Framework

### Core Principles
1. **Modularity**: Writing Assistant is designed to be decoupled and reusable.
2. **Reliability**: Engineered for high availability and consistency.
3. **Observability**: Built-in hooks for monitoring and tracing.

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Architecture Components
- **Core Engine**: The primary logic processor for writing_assistant.
- **Interface Layer**: API/Classes exposed to other modules.
- **Data Persistence**: How state/data is stored and retrieved.

### Data Flow
1. Input Data -> Validation -> Writing Assistant Process -> Output
2. Error Condition -> Exception Handler -> Fallback/Log

## 💡 Implementation Patterns

### Best Practices
- **Do**: Use typed interfaces.
- **Don't**: Bypass validation layers.

```python
# Example Usage Pattern
config = Config(mode="strict")
instance = WritingAssistant(config)
result = instance.run()
```

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Optimization of core algorithm.
- [ ] Integration with V2 API standards.
- [ ] Enhanced telemetry metrics.
